# Hydra-Three Leftover Roadmap

## API/Type Surface
- Strengthen dynamic transform typing in `/Users/kasparsj/Work2/hydra/triode/src/index.d.ts` to reduce index-signature ambiguity.

## Runtime/Error Policy
- Add built-in runtime error handling modes (for example: `warn`, `throw`) on top of the current `onError` callback.

## Release Hardening for v1.0
- Achieve two consecutive tagged releases with zero high-severity regressions.
- Add explicit release rollback/playbook documentation.
