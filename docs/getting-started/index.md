# Getting Started

This section gets you from install to a first working 3D patch quickly.

## Path

1. [Installation](./installation.md)
2. [Quickstart](./quickstart.md)
3. [First Patch](./first-patch.md)

## If you are coming from Hydra

- Keep `Hydra` as the runtime entry point.
- Keep familiar generators (`osc`, `noise`, `src`, `solid`) and chain methods.
- Add scene APIs (`stage`, `scene`, `geom`, `mat`) when moving into 3D composition.

See [Hydra in triode](../interop/hydra-in-triode.md) for a direct mapping.
